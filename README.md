Overview

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization using the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in data science. The goal is to explore, analyze, and visualize the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Tasks Covered

Data Loading and Exploration

Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Inspected the structure and checked for missing values.

Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis.

Basic Data Analysis

Computed summary statistics using .describe().

Grouped data by flower species and calculated mean values for numerical features.

Identified trends and differences among species.

Data Visualization

Line chart showing trends in petal length across samples.

Bar chart comparing average sepal width across species.

Histogram showing the distribution of petal length.

Scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and petal length.

Tools Used

Python 3

pandas for data handling

matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

scikit-learn for accessing the Iris dataset
